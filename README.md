# Dessert Clicker

App created to learn about about the `lifecycle of an android activity`

## FutureMe Notes

- Android activities begin in the `onCreate()` method
- List of all activity lifecycle states (and their methods):
    - Created (onCreate())
    - Initialized
    - Started [onStart(), OnRestart()]
    - Destroyed (onDestroy())
    - Resumed (onResume())
- the above states don't move in one predetermined single direction, they can move back and forth between each state
